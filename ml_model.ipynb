              "Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

Transition is going well, I pass, I have a wonderful new girl friend, I am back in school, I have two wonderful children.\\n\\nBut dysphoria. Yeah.  All the rest doesn't matter sometimes.

              "I take antidepressants to trick my dad into thinking I'm okI've been on and off every different kind of antidepressant available for the past 4 years. They honestly don't fucking do anything but I think it gives my dad some peace of mind because if he really knew that I wanted to legitimately blow my brains out every second of everyday, I think it would fuck him up. Oh well, the day he dies is the day I die to, just waiting for that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
              "Suicidal partner\\n\\nI'm (29/m) due to get married soon. My partner (25/f) of 4 years has always shown signs of depression, but for the most part things have gone well. She does compare herself incessantly with other people and social media doesn't help with that. The fact that I and a few of my close friends earn more than double what she does also affects her \\n\\nRecently however, with planning a wedding, things have become worse, and most recently she pulled out a knife, told me to leave so that she could end it. While this scares me massively, because I care about her a lot, I'm worried about our future together.\\n\\nI always feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her, and saying the wrong thing puts her out. Any time I try to make a valid point about her behaviour, she says things like \"I'm a horrible person anyway\". I've tried to get her to seek help but she just won't listen. I don't know if going ahead with this wedding is the right thing. \\n\\nThis probably seems really jumbled but I honestly don't know what to do or say. We might have a couple of good weeks where we enjoy each others company before the same shit starts again.\\n\\nSometimes I worry that I'm only still with her because I'm scared of what she would do without me, how she would cope. Shes said many times that I'm the only person she has.\\n\\nAny advice would be much appreciated\\n\\nTL;DR my fiance is depressed and occasionally suicidal, wedding coming up and no idea what to do\\n    1\n",
